%% Assumptions
% I am assuming a wall thickness of 1/8, or 0.125 inch, according to the
% McMaster website specifications. In the McMaster Solidworks file, the
% thickness is about 0.18 so I'm not sure how accurate these calculations
% are.

% Also, my calculations here return a volume slightly less than what my
% Solidworks Mass Properties says. Perhaps we can pretend this accounts for
% the fillets inside the box :)

%% Find volumes of all other sections of the tank, with respect to overall height

function res = Water_Tank_Calculations(overall_height)
    % CHANGE THIS, h max is 11.25 inches
    h_overall = overall_height; %11.25 - 6.5  % the overall height from the very bottom of the container, inches

    % find volume of rectangle portion at the top.
    if h_overall <= 4.5380  % this is the max heights of square + triangle
        h_rectangle = 0;
    else
        h_rectangle = h_overall - 4.5380;
    end


    % find volume of square portion at the bottom. h_square found with the
    % inside corner length in the Solidworks.
    if h_overall <= 0.6490
        h_square = h_overall;
    else
        h_square = 0.6490;
    end


    % find volume of triangle portion at the bottom.
    if h_overall <= 0.6490
        h_triangle = 0;
    elseif h_overall <= 4.5380
        h_triangle = h_overall - 0.6490;
    else
        h_triangle = 3.889;
    end

    V_triangle = V_trian(h_triangle);

    res = h_square*2*2 + V_triangle + h_rectangle*11.75*6.75;% + 7*overall_height;
end

%% change this to find Volume of the triangular portion, based on height
% height in inches, measured from the top of the square portion
% (or the bottom of the triangle portion)

% uncomment and change this height to whatever you want between 0 and 3.899
% to find just the triangle volume
%h_triangle = 3.889;

%% Set equations and solve for trianglular volume
% this is the recalculated formula, directly calculating the volume and not
% using negative space. It also accounts for the thickness of the walls.

function res = V_trian(h_trian)
    w_1 = 2;
    w_2 = 2 + 1.2214 * h_trian;
    w_3 = 0.6107 * h_trian;
    L_1 = 2;
    L_2 = 2.5071 * h_trian;

    V_1 = h_trian * 0.5 * (w_1 + w_2) * L_1;  % volume of trapezoidal prism
    V_2 = h_trian * (2/3) * L_2 * w_3;    % volume of the 2 pyramids combined
    V_3 = h_trian * 0.5 * L_2 * w_1;      % volume of triangular prism

    res = V_1 + V_2 + V_3;
end
